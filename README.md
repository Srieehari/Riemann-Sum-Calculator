This is a small project where you can input a **function** into the code and provide the **interval range** and the amount of **subintervals** 

It will calculate the trapezoid sum, midpoint sum, and simposons sum of the function.


It now calculate left sum, right sum, and all the other sums mentioned above.

I am going to add a feature that states whether the value is an underestimate or overestimate.
